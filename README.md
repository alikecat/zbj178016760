# Hi there 👋 I'm Bojun Zhang

I am a 🎓 PhD candidate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University.

I am morbidly obsessed with 📐design and 💻programming, but not limited to any particular language or environment. All the interesting things are in my recipe.

I like writing websites and mobile apps, and I'm currently learning how to generate and process pictures with pytouch, which may become another hobby.

I have no professional programming training, so my code sometimes looks amateur, but I have been improving my programming skills.

Apart from programming, I spend almost all my spare time on video games. Fortunately, it doesn't make me look fat or nerdy.

At present, I don't need anyone's sponsorship, but I am eager to make some friends to program and discuss technology together.
