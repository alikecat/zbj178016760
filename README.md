# Hi there 👋 I'm Likecat

I am a 👨‍🎓 PhD candidate in the Department of 👨‍🔧 Mechanical Engineering, 🏫 Xi'an Jiaotong University.

I am morbidly obsessed with 📐 **_designing_** and 💻 **_programming_**, but not limited to any particular language or environment. All the interesting things are in my recipe.

I like writing 📰 **_websites_** and 📱 **_mobile apps_**, and I'm currently learning how to 🎨 generate and process pictures with pytouch, which may become another hobby.

I have no professional programming training, so my code sometimes looks amateur, but I have been improving my programming skills.

Apart from programming, I spend almost all my spare time on 🎮 **_video games_**. Fortunately, it doesn't make me look fat or nerdy.

At present, I don't need anyone's sponsorship, but I am eager to make some friends to program and discuss technology together.
